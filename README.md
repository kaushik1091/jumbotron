Interactive Computer-aided Live classrooms/seminars


This is a web-app/feature (prototype) that allows interaction between the speaker and audience in large seminar or a classroom.

It helps audience/students to raise questions in a stream-lined fashion. The ability to post questions anonymously helps eliminate any hindrances.

In the perspective of a speaker, it helps him/her to understand where the audience have a problem in understanding the delivery.
This gives an opportunity to clarify/answer the questions asked instantaneously and modify/improvise the delivery in future.

The main intuition behind developing this feature is to enhance the interactive experience in the classroom environment as a whole.
